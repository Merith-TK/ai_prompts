# AI Prompts Repository - Progress Log

## Development Timeline

### Session 1: Repository Foundation
**Date**: July 11, 2025
**Completed**:
- âœ… Created basic repository structure with directories
- âœ… Built comprehensive `how_to_effectively_use_agents.md` guide
- âœ… Developed `how_to_avoid_token_rot.md` with file-based methodology
- âœ… Created initial template collection (basic, agent task)
- âœ… Set up example structure with REST API development case

**Key Insights**:
- User prefers question-driven approach over assumption-making
- File-based context management is core to the methodology
- Templates need to work for both humans and AI agents
- Real-world examples more valuable than theoretical guides

### Session 2: Content Refinement  
**Date**: July 11, 2025 (continued)
**Completed**:
- âœ… Updated REST API example to reflect proven methodology
- âœ… Enhanced `how_to_effectively_use_agents.md` with question-encouragement section
- âœ… Expanded coding prompts guide with comprehensive patterns
- âœ… Created additional templates (code analysis, context refresh)
- âœ… Built template directory with usage guidelines

**Methodology Improvements**:
- Added "Questions Welcome" sections to all templates
- Integrated file-based context management throughout
- Created comprehensive clarification response examples
- Demonstrated AI-to-AI communication patterns

### Session 3: Self-Application
**Date**: July 11, 2025 (current)
**Completed**:
- âœ… Created `action_plan.md` for this repository project
- âœ… Documented project decisions in `notes.md`
- âœ… Started `progress_log.md` to track development
- ðŸ”„ Applied our own methodology to this repository development

**Current Status**: Successfully implementing the file-based approach on our own project

## Current Phase Status

**Active Phase**: Phase 2 - Content Development
**Immediate Goals**:
- Complete creative writing prompts section
- Develop data analysis prompt patterns  
- Create additional real-world examples

**Next Session Priorities**:
1. Creative directory content development
2. Analysis directory template creation
3. Additional example implementations (debugging, testing workflows)

## Outstanding Items

### High Priority
- [ ] Creative writing prompts and templates
- [ ] Data analysis and research prompt collections
- [ ] Additional debugging and testing examples

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Advanced agent interaction patterns
- [ ] Integration guides for different IDEs
- [ ] Video demonstration content

### Future Considerations
- [ ] User feedback collection system
- [ ] Template effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Community contribution guidelines

## Success Indicators

### Methodology Validation
- âœ… Repository development following our own prescribed patterns
- âœ… File-based context preventing information loss
- âœ… Question-driven development leading to better outcomes
- âœ… Templates being used and refined through actual application

### Content Quality
- âœ… Examples based on real successful collaborations
- âœ… Templates encouraging effective agent interactions
- âœ… Documentation serving both human and AI audiences
- âœ… Progressive complexity from basic to advanced patterns

## Notes for Future Sessions

### Context Refresh Instructions
When continuing this work:
1. Read `action_plan.md` for project overview and current phase
2. Review `notes.md` for key decisions and principles
3. Check this `progress_log.md` for recent completion status
4. Reference current priority items for next steps

### Collaboration Patterns Working Well
- Explicit question encouragement leading to better requirements
- Comprehensive answers with context/examples/logic preventing rework
- File references maintaining context across conversation breaks
- Git-style progress tracking enabling safe experimentation
