# AI Prompts Repository - Action Plan

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive repository of AI prompts and methodologies, focused on effective agent interaction patterns and proven workflows.

## Goals
- Create organized collection of prompt templates and examples
- Document proven methodologies for AI agent collaboration
- Provide both human-readable guides and AI-parseable patterns
- Establish best practices for question-driven development
- Implement file-based context management to prevent token rot

## Repository Structure Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Basic repository structure created
- [x] Agent methodology guides (`how_to_effectively_use_agents.md`, `how_to_avoid_token_rot.md`)
- [x] Comprehensive template collection (basic, agent task, code analysis, context refresh)
- [x] Coding prompts guide with real-world examples
- [x] REST API development example showcasing proven workflow
- [x] Main README with repository overview

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Create `notes.md` and `progress_log.md` for this project
- [ ] Apply our own methodology to this repository development

### üìù Planned
- [ ] Creative writing prompts and templates
- [ ] Data analysis and research prompt patterns
- [ ] Additional real-world examples (debugging, refactoring, testing)
- [ ] Advanced agent interaction patterns
- [ ] Integration guides for different development environments

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- Repository structure
- Basic templates
- Agent interaction guides

### Phase 2: Content Development (Current)
- Comprehensive examples
- Domain-specific prompt collections
- Advanced templates

### Phase 3: Refinement
- User feedback integration
- Template optimization
- Additional use case examples

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Usage tutorials
- Video demonstrations
- Integration guides

## Key Principles Being Applied
1. **Question-Driven Development**: Templates encourage clarifying questions
2. **File-Based Context**: Action plans and notes prevent information loss
3. **Iterative Approach**: Phase-by-phase development with clear milestones
4. **Real-World Testing**: Examples based on actual successful collaborations
5. **Dual Audience**: Content works for both humans and AI agents

## Success Metrics
- Templates lead to more effective agent interactions
- Users report fewer misunderstandings and faster development
- Examples can be directly applied to real projects
- Methodology prevents token rot in long development sessions
